# OHDSI WebAPI Roadmap 2019

The [Atlas & WebAPI Working Group](http://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=projects:workgroups:atlas-webapi) hold scheduled calls to review progress, technical roadblocks and timelines around new features or on-going issues. This roadmap is a reflection of the working group's commitments for this year.

## Atlas/WebAPI 2.7 - Bug fixes

#### Release Date: March 2019

The 2.7 release will focus on addressing the following:
- Gaps from the v2.6.0 release. There were many items that the developer community didn't have an opportunity to finish for the v2.6.0 release and we're using the 2.7 release to close out the functionality gaps and focus on fixing outstanding issues.

## Atlas/WebAPI 2.8 - Performance Optimizations

#### Planned Release Date: May 2019

The 2.8 release will focus on optimizing features and functions in the platform. There will also be an effort to fix any outstanding bugs from the 2.7 release.

ðŸ™Œ Important note: The 2.8 release will be the final release of Atlas/WebAPI that supports the CDM v5.x specification. 

## Atlas/WebAPI 3.0 - CDM v6 Support

#### Planned Release Date: Q4 2019

The 3.0 release of Atlas/WebAPI will provide support for CDM v6.x and will be a large overhaul of the code base with an eye towards maturing the platform's core components with unit/integration tests.

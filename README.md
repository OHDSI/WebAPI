OHDSI WebAPI is a Java 8 web application that utilizes a database (PostgreSQL, SQL Server or Oracle) for storage.

## System Requirements & Installation

Documentation can be found a the [Web API Installation Guide](https://github.com/OHDSI/WebAPI/wiki) which covers the system requirements and installation instructions.

## Testing

It was chosen to use embedded PG instead of H2 for unit tests since H2 doesn't support window functions, `md5` function, HEX to BIT conversion, `setval`, `set datestyle`, CTAS + CTE.
